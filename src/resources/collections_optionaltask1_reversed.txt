Here, beneath my lungs, I feel your thumbs press into my skin again
And I don't know if I can
Now my head's splitting at the seams
You were never supposed to leave
Bar the door, please don't let them in
All my nightmares escaped my head
I've come home
You can throw them out or keep them in your mason jars
I don't need them anymore
Heal the scars from off my back
If you find one, please let me know what piece I've lost
Some have names but most do not
Ships are launching from my chest
Welcome home
Was never much but we made the most
Like a row of captured ghosts over old dead grass
Sheets are swaying from an old clothesline
And the backs of my eyes hum with things I've never done
And the days blur into one
Sleep don't visit, so I choke on sun
